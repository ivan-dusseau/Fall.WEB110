       <p>I'm Ivan Dusseau, a third-year college student and robotics enthusiast. I've been coding for a long time, and I needed to touch up on the basics again. Generally, I prefer to dink around with the physical side of web development and machines in general. There's nothing wrong with coding, but I find it frustrating when I can't feel what's wrong.</p>
           
      <p>I was part of a robotics team for four years and had the privilege of participating in the world championship. I had a fantastic time working in a midsize team working towards a common goal. I learned the value of understanding your teammates and choosing the right people for the right jobs.</p>

       <h3>Please Help Me</h3>

       <p>The world is a spooky place. There are ghosts and ghouls and goblins this time of year, so it's best to stay inside. Without the comfort of light you can't quite be sure what is out there, waiting in the dark crevices at the edges of the light. Lurking at the edges of your vision, fidgeting where people can't quite see grasp. Generations of humans have known the fear of the dark, known to fear what flees from the fire.</p>

       <p>So for generations, humans have flocked to the fire and the light. But never has anyone started to question the light. Perhaps it's better to ask not if the light will keep you safe, and instead question what's lurking in the light.</p>
